Load balancer using pox controller -computer network project

     Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the new field in the modern network world. The SDN is more flexible and efficient than the traditional network. The main usage of SDN is the server load balancing strategy. The load on the servers is increasing day by day with the internet usage and due to this end users might be dis-satisfied due to server down. Therefore, there is a need to balance these load on servers in order to provide efficient services to end users without any delay. The main issues with the present networking trend are the slow response and delays.
        In our proposed system, Random and Round Robin load balancing strategies are implemented using an OpenFlow switch connected to a POX controller that are based on python in SDN. Mininet is used to create a virtual topology of these nodes. Finally, Siege HTTP load testing tool is used to test network performance. The testing focused on Quality of Service (QoS) parameters throughput, average response time and transaction rate.


INTRODUCTION 

     For the past few years, there have been significant changes in the network requirements, exponential growth in traffic, and the need for more challenging end to-end objectives. The primary hosting infrastructures for Internet applications and services are data centers (i.e., social networks, Internet banking, and multimedia content). In such data center networks, traditional load balancing algorithms use customized hard- ware devices to divide network traffic among various server copies. Although this method generally produces excellent performance, it is expensive and has a rigid configuration that cannot be dynamically changed in response to the status of the network or other information. 
     
      Nowadays, software defined networking is used to move a lot of data. There is a lot of traffic, which has significantly grown. It is vital to address this kind of congestion issue so that networks can be made more effective. Decoupling the data and control planes is made possible by software defined networking. As a result, the network administrators use an external SDN controller to operate their network. It makes use of a unique kind of controller with the ability to manipulate the network’s forwarding behavior. The SDN-depicted network architecture is very versatile, and the network administrator can benefit from the programmability of SDN-enabled switches  


           Creating a virtual topology over Mininet, improvement in the bandwidth, latency and cost of transportation of data have distinctly been displayed longwith further scope for the project.Legacy devices and networking protocols have dominated the networking industry since the past few decades. Companies such as Juniper, Cisco, Arista, Akamai etc. have been researching newer avenues at overcoming the limitations of the traditional architecture of network management taking into account the changing traffic trends, boost of devices connected to the Internet, increase in the number of IoT devices, rise of the ‘Big Data’ era and cloud servers.
